        <h1 class="section-title">Welcome to my blog!</h1>
        <p>This blog once belonged to someone else. A man of great knowledge and generosity—<a href="https://www.kevinpowell.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kevin Powell</a>—who shares insights, solutions, and resources for front-end development. His work remains invaluable. His wisdom, respected.</p>
        <p>And yet, here we are. The blog is now mine. Not stolen, of course. That would be uncouth, and Vizt Nivlir does not take—he merely steps in when the moment presents itself. Let’s call it an orderly transition of power.</p>
        <p>Below are some of my favorite articles. Or, if you prefer to live in the present, you can browse my most recent posts on the Blog Page.</p>
