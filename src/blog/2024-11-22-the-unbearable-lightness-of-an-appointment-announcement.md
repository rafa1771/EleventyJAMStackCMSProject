Language is a curious thing. When the phrase “will see you now” is uttered, it suggests not just a meeting, but a reckoning. It is a passive construction of enormous consequence—an acceptance into an audience with an entity who, until now, has remained distant, unknowable. And today, that entity is me.

But what am I meant to do with this power? Am I to gaze upon the individual with benevolence? With scrutiny? Should I nod sagely, as if to imply I already understand their concerns before they even speak? There is an art to being “seen,” and an even greater art in seeing others. Perhaps that is the greatest performance of all: the illusion that any of us, in these absurdly orchestrated interactions, are truly being perceived. I adjust my coat, take a breath, and, as the door swings open, prepare to greet the next bewildered soul.
