There is a question that humans ask with great frequency and almost no intention of pursuing: “*How are you?*” It arrives as an incantation, a verbal knock at the door of civility. The expectation is not an answer, but an echo: “*Good, thanks—and you?*” Anything beyond that, and one is seen as meddling with the agreed-upon fiction.

Occasionally, I experiment.

“*Mildly haunted by an unfinished side project.*”

“*Experiencing a manageable dread.*”

“*Physically fine, existentially undefined.*”

These responses are often met with polite laughter and a quick change of subject, which confirms my theory: the question is not a question at all, but a performance. A signal that the conversation may proceed.

I don’t object to it. Ritual has its place. But I do wonder—what would happen if someone answered truthfully? If, just once, someone said, “*I don’t know, actually. Things are shifting beneath the surface.*” Would the conversation deepen? Or would it simply collapse under the weight of too much reality?

For now, I smile, nod, and respond in kind.

Because that, I’m told, is how one participates.
