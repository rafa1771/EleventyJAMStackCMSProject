There are certain phrases that arrive like an aftershock—seemingly harmless, but capable of destabilizing an entire day. *“Just make it pop”* is one such phrase. It enters the chat—casual, breezy, devoid of context—and suddenly I am plunged into a philosophical spiral.

What is *“pop”?* A color? A feeling? A metaphysical state? Does “pop” refer to brightness? Contrast? Motion? Should the element literally jump out? Should it sparkle? Should it quietly demand attention like a very well-dressed man entering a silent room?

And more importantly: to whom must it pop? The client? The user? The CEO’s teenage nephew?

I stare at the screen. I toggle the saturation. I increase the drop shadow. I add a tasteful hover animation. I remove it. I sigh. I place my hooves gently on the keyboard and do what we all do in these moments: I improvise something visually arresting, upload a screenshot, and await the inevitable response—*“Yes! That’s exactly what I meant.”*

It never is. But somehow, against all logic, I’ve made it pop.
