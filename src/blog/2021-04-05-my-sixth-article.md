There is a razor-thin margin of acceptable door-holding etiquette. Too soon, and the person feels obligated to speed up, cursing your generosity. Too late, and you are an irredeemable monster.

I, of course, hold doors with impeccable timing. However, even I am not immune to miscalculations. Just yesterday, I found myself in the dreaded _long-distance eye contact hold_. A person too far away, yet already aware of my presence. The unspoken agreement had been made—I could not, in good conscience, let the door close. And so, I waited. They jogged awkwardly, giving a breathless thank you upon arrival. We both suffered. I vowed never to misjudge again.
