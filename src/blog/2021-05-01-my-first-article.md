Few things in life strip a person of their dignity quite like the realization that they have just sent a professional email with no subject line. It is an offense so grievous, so lacking in structure, that even I—a being of unwavering composure—felt the full weight of existential despair upon seeing it unfold before me.

What message does this omission send? Am I a careless individual? A man of mystery? A creature too free-spirited for conventional email structures? I attempt to rectify my mistake, sending a correction email, but the damage is done. The original, empty of context, lingers in inboxes like an unanswered question. There is no recovering from this. There is only acceptance.
